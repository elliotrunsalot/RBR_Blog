    <h1>About</h1>
    
    <p>My name is Elliot and I'm a bit slow. I didn't find running until I was twenty-eight years old and suffering my way through an interminable advanced degree in, well, let's just say philosophy. In those years I spent carefully reasoning and elucidating an argument that ultimately few people would read, and fewer would care about, I would look in vein for a light at the end of the tunnel; for a way out.

        One day I picked up Haruki Murakami's memoire - What I Talk About When I Talk About Running - and something changed. I felt a sensation I'd never felt before: the desire to go... running. Mutsumi, my wife, took up running with me. Soon 1km became 5km, and 5km became 10km. In 2014 Mutsumi and I moved to Fukui City on the west coast of Japan. This was an opportunity to take our running off the pavement and into the mountains. 
        
        Running got me through that degree in which reasoning became in and of itself unreasonable, and it's taken Mutsumi and me on some great adventures. This blog is about those adventures. It's here to keep a memory of things we have done, and to share our knowledge of the trails and Country on which we run. It's also here to stand as a record of how running can take us beyond the things in life that make us feel stuck, to places where we can be free.</p>
